## Ground Rules
_This section will set expectations for behavior for everyone_

* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (`.gitignore``).
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code. 
* Each pull request should implement **ONE** feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
